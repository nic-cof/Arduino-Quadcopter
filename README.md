# Arduino-Quadcopter
Code from testing quadcopter components through completion.

Goal: 
Create an autonomous quadcopter using Arduino components. Create code for stable flight, sensors, and navigation.

Method: 
Code will be stored from each test to track progress. Use old code to learn from when new issues arise.
Thorough testing of individual components in quick iterations. Build from simple code and add more complex elements.
Combine individual codes into final flight code.

Progress: 
(AUG 3, 2016) U2
Second code failed. Found instructable with ESC code, worked like a charm. Started with ESC_A. Added ESC_B, _C, and _D after.
All four can be controlled from a single input.
Next iteration will add bluetooth to remove tether.

(AUG 3, 2016)
Used old code from ESC and could not get it to function. Trying new method.

(AUG 2, 2016)
Using code found on internet froma similar project to test and configure ESCs. Previous attempt at this project was based off this code.
Fiddled with code for extensive time before researching alternative methods.
